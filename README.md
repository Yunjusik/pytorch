ML,DRL examples
This Repository is based on pytorch official tutorial, 
"https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html"

This repository is really made for beginners.
Many GitHub examples have different structures and strong version dependency, so it is difficult to tune them to your own situation.
Therefore, in this repository, we are going to build the latest DRL model by changing only the functional blocks little by little in the official Python tutorial.

In the future, RL models will be uploaded so that they can be applied to directly with no more modification to the tutorial DQN model shown in cart-pole example

Up to now, Double DQN and Dueling network have been updated.

Requirements
python >= 3.5
torch version >= 1.0
